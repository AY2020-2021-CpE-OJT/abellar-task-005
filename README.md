# Phonebook App
A Flutter project that uses REST API as backend in Express Node.js and MongoDB for the database.

## Task 5
Securing API using JWT and Passport Framework.
_Specific Updates_ Add a function for CRUD Operation using the secure route on API. The function for regular route is still there but is unused. 

# ScreenFlow
The first/home screen has form that accepts the first name, last name, and the phone numbers.
The user can enter multiple phone numbers. The user can view the contacts he/she created in the second screen.
The contacts that can be found in the second screen are from locally stored variable and the database.
The user can edit or delete contacts from the list that will also reflect to the database.
The local variable list is just for compliance to the 3rd task and no addition functionality was added to it.

### Note
I have not yet put some input validation. Some have and some do not have because I am still on exploring and familiarization of Flutter.

### Personal Note:
The structure and organization is kinda messy. I am still working on it and will try to clean it up next time.
